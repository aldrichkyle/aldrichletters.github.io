				<p class="greetings"> Dear Beloved,</p>
				<p> As I look at us now, a lot has changed. Most of insecurities and small things that most couple fight over are now gone. Moreover, space is given unconditionally unlike new couples where space is the biggest issue of all. </p><br>
				<p>I am confident that I have fully known you and that I can surely cheer you up whenever you’re down. Every hobby, habbit, favorite you have now, I can surely enumerate almost all of them. We have gone through a lot these years and I know that you are the woman that I am going to marry maybe sometime in the next decade.  </p><br>
				<p>We’ll share the struggle of making time for each other despite taking up very demanding courses. As well as the struggle for planning our wedding which I am sure you’ll struggle more than I will. I will work very hard in order to give you the life that you wish to live as well as maybe bare a child of our own that will continue our bloodline.  </p>	<br>
				<p>I will love you until the day I die and hopefully be your next husband on our next life.</p> <br>
