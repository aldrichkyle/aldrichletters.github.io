				<p class="greetings"> To my future wife,</p>
				<p> The ultimate milestone that I will be challenging myself for the next decade is for you to be mine officially and legally. </p><br>
				<p>Seeing that most young adult have a goal of securing a career that will sustain their live for the rest of eternity makes me sad. For me, this only comes second, because my priority is to be wed to the human I love the most whom I would want to spend the remaining years I have on earth. </p><br>
				<p>I promise you that we will live a good life. Weâ€™ll spend our honeymoon on the finest beaches and go home to a not too luxurious but a good home where it is comfortable and never go old. </p>	<br>
				<p>I may not be the perfect husband for all but I promise that I will be the best husband for you.</p> <br>
				<p>P.S. Having kids is optional depends on you. </p>
